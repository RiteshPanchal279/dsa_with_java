The ``distro`` package (``distro`` stands for Linux Distribution) provides
information about the Linux distribution it runs on, such as a reliable
machine-readable distro ID, or version information.

It is the recommended replacement for Python's original
:py:func:`platform.linux_distribution` function, but it provides much more
functionality. An alternative implementation became necessary because Python
3.5 deprecated this function, and Python 3.8 removed it altogether. Its
predecessor function :py:func:`platform.dist` was already deprecated since
Python 2.6 and removed in Python 3.8. Still, there are many cases in which
access to OS distribution information is needed. See `Python issue 1322
<https://bugs.python.org/issue1322>`_ for more information.
